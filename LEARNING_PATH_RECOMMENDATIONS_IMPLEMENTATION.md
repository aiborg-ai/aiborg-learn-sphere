   ├── Weak/strong categories
   ├── Audience type & industry
   ├── Current skill level
   └── Completed courses

2. Path Generation (4 Types)
   ├── Weakness-Focused Path
   │   ├── Identify weak categories
   │   ├── Find relevant courses
   │   ├── Calculate relevance scores
   │   └── Sequence by difficulty
   │
   ├── Career Advancement Path
   │   ├── Filter advanced courses

   │   ├── Target professional growth
   │   └── Focus on expertise
   │
   ├── Quick Wins Path
   │   ├── Short courses (<8 hours)
   │   ├── High-impact content
   │   ├── Fast completion (2 weeks)
   │   └── Build momentum
   │
   └── Mastery Path
       ├── Comprehensive curriculum
       ├── All skill areas
