## 🔍 **How to Verify in Database**

To check which posts are actually in your production database, run:

### **Quick Check Query:**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  slug,
  status,
  LENGTH(content) as content_chars,
  published_at
FROM blog_posts
WHERE status = 'published'
ORDER BY published_at DESC;
```

### **Content Quality Audit:**
```sql
-- See which published posts have full content
SELECT
  title,
  status,
  LENGTH(content) as chars,
  CASE
    WHEN LENGTH(content) >= 2000 THEN '✅ FULL ARTICLE'
    WHEN LENGTH(content) >= 500 THEN '✅ HAS CONTENT'
    WHEN LENGTH(content) > 0 THEN '⚠️ TOO SHORT'
    ELSE '❌ EMPTY'
  END as quality
FROM blog_posts
WHERE status = 'published'
ORDER BY LENGTH(content) DESC;
```
