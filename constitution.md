# AIBorg Learn Sphere - Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Educational Excellence
- Provide high-quality, accessible AI and technology education
- Support multiple learning styles and audiences (Primary, Secondary, Professional, Business)
- Enable self-paced and instructor-led learning paths

### 2. User Experience
- **Simplicity First**: Clean, intuitive interfaces that prioritize ease of use
- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all devices
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, inclusive for all learners
- **Performance**: Fast loading times (< 3s initial load, < 1s route transitions)

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **TypeScript First**: Strong typing for maintainability and developer experience
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable, composable React components
- **Testing Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage for critical paths
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive inline documentation and README files

### 4. Security & Privacy
- **Data Protection**: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- **Authentication**: Secure, multi-factor authentication support
- **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection, user consent for all tracking
- **Regular Security Audits**: Quarterly security reviews and updates

### 5. Technical Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Loosely coupled services and components
- **API-First**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL consideration for complex queries
- **Database Optimization**: Efficient queries, proper indexing, caching strategies
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability, microservices-ready architecture

### 6. Development Practices
- **Git Flow**: Feature branches, pull requests, code reviews
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing, linting, and deployment pipelines
- **Semantic Versioning**: Clear version management and changelog
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, comprehensive error logging

### 7. Business Alignment
- **Course Management**: Flexible course creation and management tools
- **Enrollment System**: Streamlined enrollment with payment integration
- **Analytics**: Comprehensive learning analytics and progress tracking
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations/institutions

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No Console Logs in Production**: Use proper logging utilities
2. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets in environment variables
3. **Mobile-First Design**: Every feature must work on mobile
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Breaking changes require migration paths
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Every new feature must pass accessibility checks

## Decision Framework

When making architectural or feature decisions, prioritize in this order:
1. User safety and data security
2. Educational effectiveness
3. User experience and accessibility
4. Performance and scalability
5. Developer experience and maintainability
6. Cost optimization

## Technology Stack Commitments
