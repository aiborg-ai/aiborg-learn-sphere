## üîó Linking Questions to Assessment Tools

After creating questions, you need to link them to assessment tools (AI-Awareness, AI-Fluency,
etc.).

**Option 1: Manual SQL** (for now)

```sql
-- Link question to AI-Awareness tool
INSERT INTO assessment_question_pools (tool_id, question_id, is_active, weight)
VALUES (
  (SELECT id FROM assessment_tools WHERE slug = 'ai-awareness'),
  'your-question-id-here',
  true,
  1.0
);
```

**Option 2: Bulk Link by Category** (recommended)

```sql
-- Link all AI Fundamentals questions to AI-Awareness
INSERT INTO assessment_question_pools (tool_id, question_id, is_active, weight)
SELECT
  (SELECT id FROM assessment_tools WHERE slug = 'ai-awareness'),
  id,
  true,
  1.0
FROM assessment_questions
WHERE is_active = true
  AND category_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM assessment_categories
    WHERE name = 'AI Fundamentals'
  )
ON CONFLICT (tool_id, question_id) DO NOTHING;
```

## üé® Best Practices

5. **Plausible Distractors**: Wrong answers should be believable

### Difficulty Balance

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Category dropdown is empty"

**Issue**: No categories exist **Fix**: Run migration to create categories or add them manually:

```sql
INSERT INTO assessment_categories (name)
VALUES
  ('AI Fundamentals'),
  ('AI Applications'),
  ('AI Ethics');
```

### "Can't save question"

**Issue**: Missing required fields or validation errors **Fix**: Check that:

- Question text is at least 5 characters
- Category is selected
- At least one audience is selected
- At least one option exists (for choice questions)
- At least one option is marked as correct

### "Question doesn't appear in assessment"

**Issue**: Question not linked to assessment tool **Fix**: Link the question to the tool using SQL
(see "Linking Questions" section)
