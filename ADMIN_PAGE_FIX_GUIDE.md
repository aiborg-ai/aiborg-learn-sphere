## üîç How to Diagnose Admin Access Issues

### Step 1: Check Browser Console Logs

When you try to access `/admin`, check the browser console (F12) for detailed logs:

**Look for these log messages:**

```
[useAuth] Checking for existing session...
[useAuth] Existing session check: { hasSession: true, userId: "...", email: "..." }
[useAuth] Fetching profile for user: ...
[useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: { role: "admin", ... }
[Admin] Auth loaded, checking admin access: { isAdmin: true, ... }
[Admin] Access granted - fetching admin data
```

**If you see errors:**

```
[useAuth] Error fetching profile: { code: "...", message: "..." }
[Admin] Access denied - redirecting to home: { reason: "Not admin role", currentRole: "user" }
```

This tells you exactly what's wrong!

---

### Step 2: Use the SQL Diagnostic Script

Run the `FIX_ADMIN_ACCESS.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard:**
   - https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj/sql

2. **Open the SQL file:**
   - Located at: `/home/vik/aiborg_CC/aiborg-learn-sphere/FIX_ADMIN_ACCESS.sql`

3. **Follow the steps in the script:**
   - STEP 1: Check all profiles
   - STEP 2: Find your profile
   - STEP 3: Update role to admin
   - STEP 4: Verify the update

**Quick Fix Template (copy and run):**

```sql
-- Replace YOUR_EMAIL@example.com with your actual email
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'admin', updated_at = now()
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';

-- Verify it worked
SELECT email, role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL@example.com';
```

---

### Step 3: Check the Error Message on /admin Page

When you try to access `/admin` without proper access, you'll now see:

**Instead of silent redirect, you'll see:**

1. **"Authentication Required"** - You're not signed in
   - Action: Click "Sign In" button

2. **"Profile Not Found"** - Your profile doesn't exist
   - Action: Click "Retry" or sign out/in again
   - Check database to ensure profile was created

3. **"Admin Access Required"** - Your role is not admin
   - Shows your current role
   - Action: Update role in database using SQL script

**Development Mode Bonus:**

In development (`npm run dev`), you'll see a debug info box showing:

- User ID
- Email
- Profile ID
- Current role
- Denial reason
- Profile error (if any)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Admin Access Required" - Role is 'user'

**Cause:** Your account exists but role is not admin

**Fix:**

1. Run this SQL in Supabase:

```sql
UPDATE profiles SET role = 'admin' WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

2. **IMPORTANT:** Sign out and sign in again to refresh session

3. Try accessing `/admin` again

---

### Issue 2: "Profile Not Found"

**Cause:** No profile row exists for your user

**Fix:**

1. Check if auth user exists:

```sql
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

2. Create profile:

```sql
INSERT INTO profiles (user_id, email, display_name, role)
SELECT id, email, COALESCE(raw_user_meta_data->>'display_name', email), 'admin'
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```

3. Sign out and sign in again

---

### Issue 3: Profile Fetch Error in Console

**Cause:** RLS policy blocking access or database connection issue

**Fix:**

1. Check console for error code
2. Common error codes:
   - `PGRST116` - Row not found (profile doesn't exist)
   - `PGRST301` - Row Level Security blocking access
   - `Connection error` - Database connection issue

3. For RLS issues, verify policies exist:

```sql
SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'profiles';
```

Expected policies:

- "Users can view their own profile"
- "Admins can view all profiles"

---

### Issue 4: Still Redirecting After Fixing Database

**Cause:** Browser cached old session data

**Fix:**

**Option A: Sign Out/In (Recommended)**

1. Sign out completely
2. Close browser tab
3. Open new tab
4. Sign in again
5. Try `/admin`

**Option B: Clear Browser Storage**

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear Storage ‚Üí Clear site data
4. Refresh and sign in

**Option C: Hard Refresh**

1. Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
2. Or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)

---

### Issue 5: Role is 'admin' but Still Can't Access (user_id Mismatch) ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL

**Cause:** The `user_id` in your profile row doesn't match your `auth.users.id`

**Symptoms:**

- Database shows `role = 'admin'` ‚úÖ
- You're signed in successfully ‚úÖ
- Still redirected from `/admin` ‚ùå
- Console shows: `[useAuth] Profile not found for user` ‚ùå

**Why this happens:**

The frontend looks up your profile like this:

```javascript
.from('profiles')
.eq('user_id', currentAuthUserId)  // Must match!
.single()
```

If `profile.user_id` doesn't match the auth user's ID, the profile isn't found even though it
exists!

**How to diagnose:**

1. **Run the diagnostic script:**
   - Open: `DIAGNOSE_ADMIN_ISSUE.sql`
   - Run in Supabase SQL Editor
   - Look for: `‚ùå MISMATCH - NEEDS FIX`

2. **Check the Quick Summary query:**

```sql
SELECT
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') as auth_user_id,
  (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') as profile_user_id,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') =
         (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com')
    THEN '‚úÖ LINKED CORRECTLY'
    ELSE '‚ùå MISMATCH FOUND'
  END as status;
```

**Fix:**

**Step 1: Run the fix script**

- Open: `FIX_USER_ID_MISMATCH.sql`
- Execute in Supabase SQL Editor
- Verify: Final summary shows `‚úÖ FIX SUCCESSFUL`

**Step 2: Quick fix command** (if you prefer one-liner):

```sql
-- Replace YOUR_EMAIL with your actual email
UPDATE profiles
SET
  user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL'),
  updated_at = now()
WHERE email = 'YOUR_EMAIL';

-- Verify the fix
SELECT
  p.user_id as profile_user_id,
  au.id as auth_user_id,
  CASE WHEN p.user_id = au.id THEN '‚úÖ FIXED' ELSE '‚ùå STILL WRONG' END as status
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON au.email = p.email
WHERE p.email = 'YOUR_EMAIL';
```

**Step 3: Test**

1. Sign out completely
2. Sign in again
3. Go to `/admin`
4. Success! ‚úÖ

**Real-world example:**

```
Database shows:
profiles table:
  email: hirendra@gmail.com
  role: admin ‚úÖ
  user_id: "old-uuid-xyz-789" ‚ùå WRONG!

auth.users table:
  email: hirendra@gmail.com
  id: "current-uuid-abc-123" ‚úÖ CORRECT

Problem: old-uuid-xyz-789 ‚â† current-uuid-abc-123
Solution: Update profile.user_id to "current-uuid-abc-123"
```

**Common causes:**

- Profile was created for a different auth account
- Auth account was deleted and recreated
- Manual profile insertion with wrong user_id
- Database migration error
- Multiple sign-up methods (email vs OAuth) created separate accounts
