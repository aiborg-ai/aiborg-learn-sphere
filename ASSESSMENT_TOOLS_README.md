## üöÄ **GETTING STARTED**

### **Step 1: Run Database Migrations**

Since the database connection from this environment didn't work, you'll need to run the migrations
manually:

```bash
# Option A: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db push

# Option B: Via psql (replace with your connection string)
PGPASSWORD='your-password' psql -h your-host.supabase.com -p 5432 -U postgres.xxx -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20251023000000_assessment_tools_category.sql

PGPASSWORD='your-password' psql -h your-host.supabase.com -p 5432 -U postgres.xxx -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20251023010000_sample_ai_awareness_questions.sql

PGPASSWORD='your-password' psql -h your-host.supabase.com -p 5432 -U postgres.xxx -d postgres -f supabase/migrations/20251023020000_sample_ai_fluency_questions.sql

# Option C: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy and paste the SQL from each migration file into the SQL editor
```

### **Step 2: Build and Run**

```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Or build for production
npm run build
```

### **Step 3: Test the Feature**

1. **Home Page** ‚Üí Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`
2. **Select Audience** ‚Üí Choose "Teenagers", "SMEs", or "Professionals"
3. **Assessment Tools Section** ‚Üí Scroll to see available assessments
4. **Click a Card** ‚Üí Start an assessment
5. **Take Assessment** ‚Üí Answer adaptive questions
6. **View Results** ‚Üí See score, analytics, recommendations
7. **View History** ‚Üí Check progress and trends

3. **IRT Calibration** - Adjust difficulty parameters based on real user data
4. **Performance Testing** - Test with many concurrent users
5. **Analytics** - Add tracking for question performance
6. **Admin Tools** - Build UI to manage questions without SQL

---

## üêõ **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Questions not appearing**

- Check migrations ran successfully
- Verify `assessment_question_pools` table has entries
- Check tool `is_active = true`
- Verify audience filters match selected audience

### **Assessment won't start**

- Check user is authenticated
- Verify tool exists and is active
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify assessment_tool_attempts table is writable

### **Results not showing**

- Check attempt completed successfully
- Verify `is_completed = true` in database
- Check `assessment_id` linked to attempt
- Verify performance data saved

### **Audience filtering not working**

- Check PersonalizationContext state
- Verify `target_audiences` array in tools
- Check audience mapping in hooks

## üìù **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Run Migrations** - Apply SQL to your Supabase database
2. **Test Locally** - Run `npm run dev` and test all flows
3. **Verify Data** - Check Supabase dashboard for created records
4. **Add More Questions** - Scale up question banks
5. **Build Admin UI** - Create tools to manage questions
6. **Deploy** - Push to Vercel and test in production
