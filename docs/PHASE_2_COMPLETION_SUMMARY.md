## 💡 Technical Highlights

### 1. **Type Safety**

```typescript
export interface PaymentTransaction {
  id: string;
  enrollment_id: string | null;
  user_id: string;
  // ... fully typed
}

export interface RefundRequest {
  id: string;
  refund_status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'rejected' | 'processed' | 'completed';
  // ... with proper status types
}
```

### 2. **CSV Export Implementation**

```typescript
const exportToCSV = () => {
  const headers = ['Student Name', 'Email', 'Course', 'Enrolled Date', 'Payment Status', 'Amount'];
  const rows = filteredEnrollments.map(e => [...]);
  const csvContent = [headers.join(','), ...rows.map(row => row.map(cell => `"${cell}"`).join(','))].join('\n');
  // Download with timestamp
};
```

### 3. **Role-Based Access**

```typescript
if (profile?.role !== 'admin') {
  query = query.eq('user_id', user.id); // Users see only their data
}
```

### 4. **Audit Trail Integration**

```typescript
await logEnrollmentCreated(enrollment.id, {
  user_id: selectedUser.id,
  type: 'manual',
  // ... metadata
});
```
