npx supabase functions deploy send-email-notification

# Verify deployment
npx supabase functions list
```

### 2. Set Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Supabase Edge Function secrets:

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
APP_URL=https://aiborg-ai-web.vercel.app

Add these events to Stripe webhook configuration:
- `checkout.session.completed`
- `customer.subscription.created`
- `customer.subscription.updated`
- `customer.subscription.deleted`
- `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- `invoice.payment_failed`

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

SELECT * FROM send_email_notification(
  'your-email@example.com'::text,
  'family_membership_welcome'::text,
  '{"primaryMemberName": "Test User", "maxFamilyMembers": 5, ...}'::jsonb
);
```

#### Test Invitation Email:

  member_name: 'Test Family Member',
  member_email: 'family@example.com',
  member_age: 30,
  relationship: 'spouse',

## üìà Monitoring

### View Sent Emails

```sql
-- Check all family membership emails sent
SELECT * FROM email_notifications_log
WHERE notification_type IN (
  'family_membership_welcome',
  'family_invitation',
  'membership_payment_success',
  'membership_payment_failed',
  'membership_lifecycle',
  'membership_expiration_warning'
)
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;

-- Count by type
SELECT notification_type, COUNT(*) as count
FROM email_notifications_log
WHERE notification_type LIKE 'family%' OR notification_type LIKE 'membership%'
GROUP BY notification_type;

-- Check delivery status in Resend
SELECT email_id, user_email, notification_type, sent_at
FROM email_notifications_log
WHERE sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY sent_at DESC;
```

### Resend Dashboard

1. Go to https://resend.com/emails
2. Search by email_id from logs
3. View delivery status, opens, clicks
4. Check bounce/spam reports

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. **Check Resend API Key**
   ```bash
   npx supabase secrets list
   # Verify RESEND_API_KEY is set
   ```

2. **Check Edge Function Logs**
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions logs send-email-notification --tail
   npx supabase functions logs stripe-webhook-subscription --tail
   ```

3. **Check User Preferences**
   ```sql
   SELECT email_notifications, notification_preferences
   FROM profiles
   WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
   ```

### Invitation Links Not Working

1. **Verify Token Generation**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, email, invitation_token, invitation_expires_at
   FROM family_members
   WHERE email = 'invitee@example.com';
   ```

2. **Check Expiration**
   ```sql
   SELECT id, name, email,
     invitation_expires_at,
     invitation_expires_at > NOW() as is_valid
   FROM family_members
   WHERE invitation_token = 'token-here';
   ```

3. **Check Accept Invitation Page**
   - Ensure page exists at `/family-membership/accept-invitation`
   - Verify token parsing from URL query params
   - Check RPC function `accept_family_invitation` exists

### Payment Emails Not Triggered

1. **Verify Webhook Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Check Stripe webhook events
   stripe webhooks list

   # Test webhook endpoint
   stripe listen --forward-to your-webhook-url
   ```

2. **Check Stripe Metadata**
   ```javascript
   // Ensure metadata is set when creating checkout
   {
     metadata: {
       user_id: 'user-uuid',
       plan_id: 'plan-uuid'
     }
   }
   ```

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Respect User Preferences
Always check email preferences before sending:
```typescript
const { data: profile } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('email_notifications, notification_preferences')
  .eq('email', userEmail)
  .single();

if (!profile?.email_notifications) return;
```

### 2. Handle Errors Gracefully
```typescript
try {
  await sendFamilyInvitationEmail(params);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to send invitation email:', error);
  // Don't block user flow
  // Log to monitoring service
}
```

### 3. Use Descriptive Subjects
- ‚úÖ "üéâ Welcome to the Aiborg Family Membership!"
- ‚úÖ "‚ö†Ô∏è Payment Failed - Action Required for Family Membership"
- ‚ùå "Notification"
- ‚ùå "Update"

### 4. Test Before Deploying
```bash
# Local testing
npx supabase functions serve send-email-notification

# Test with curl
curl -X POST http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/send-email-notification \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"to": "test@example.com", "type": "family_membership_welcome", ...}'
```

### 5. Monitor Delivery Rates
- Track open rates (>20% is good)
- Monitor bounce rates (<5% is healthy)
- Watch spam complaints (<0.1% is acceptable)
- Review unsubscribe rates (adjust if >2%)
