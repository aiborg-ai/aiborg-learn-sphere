## üìã Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Backup Production Database ‚ö†Ô∏è

**CRITICAL: Always backup before migrations!**

```bash
# Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard
# 1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
# 2. Navigate to Database ‚Üí Backups
# 3. Click "Create Backup"
# 4. Wait for completion

# Option B: Using pg_dump (if you have direct access)
pg_dump -h aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com \
  -U postgres.afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj \
  -d postgres \
  -f backup_quiz_system_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Verify backup file exists and has content
ls -lh backup_quiz_system_*.sql
```

---

### Step 2: Review Migration File

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql`

**What it contains:**

- 12 new tables (quiz, exercise, workshop systems)
- 15 performance indexes
- RLS policies for all tables
- Helper functions (calculate_quiz_score, award_activity_points)
- Triggers for auto-timestamps

**Verify the file:**

```bash
# Check file exists
ls -l supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql

# Count lines (should be ~650)
wc -l supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql

# Quick syntax check (optional)
head -50 supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql
```

---

### Step 3: Test on Staging (Recommended) üß™

**If you have a staging environment:**

```bash
# Set staging credentials
export STAGING_HOST="your-staging-host"
export STAGING_DB="postgres"
export STAGING_USER="postgres.your-staging-id"
export PGPASSWORD="your-staging-password"

# Run migration on staging
psql -h $STAGING_HOST \
  -U $STAGING_USER \
  -d $STAGING_DB \
  -f supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql

# Verify tables were created
psql -h $STAGING_HOST \
  -U $STAGING_USER \
  -d $STAGING_DB \
  -c "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' AND (table_name LIKE 'quiz%' OR table_name LIKE 'exercise%' OR table_name LIKE 'workshop%');"

# Expected output: 12 tables
# quiz_banks, quiz_questions, quiz_options, quiz_attempts, quiz_responses
# exercises, exercise_submissions
# workshops, workshop_sessions, workshop_participants, workshop_stage_submissions, workshop_activities
```

---

### Step 4: Run Migration on Production üöÄ

**IMPORTANT: Run during low-traffic period!**

#### Option A: Using Supabase Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to: `https://app.supabase.com/project/[your-project]/sql`

2. **Open SQL Editor**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New Query"

3. **Copy Migration SQL**

   ```bash
   # Open the migration file
   cat supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql
   ```

   - Copy entire contents
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor

4. **Execute**
   - Click "Run" button
   - Wait for completion (should take 5-10 seconds)
   - Check for any error messages

5. **Verify Success**
   - Run this verification query in SQL Editor:

   ```sql
   SELECT table_name
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE table_schema='public'
   AND (table_name LIKE 'quiz%'
     OR table_name LIKE 'exercise%'
     OR table_name LIKE 'workshop%')
   ORDER BY table_name;
   ```

   - Should return 12 rows

#### Option B: Using psql Command Line

```bash
# Set production credentials
export PGHOST="aws-0-ap-south-1.pooler.supabase.com"
export PGPORT="5432"
export PGDATABASE="postgres"
export PGUSER="postgres.afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj"
export PGPASSWORD="hirendra\$1234ABCD"

# Run migration
psql -f supabase/migrations/20251013000000_quizzes_exercises_workshops.sql

# Verify
psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' AND (table_name LIKE 'quiz%' OR table_name LIKE 'exercise%' OR table_name LIKE 'workshop%');"
```

**Expected Output:**

```
 table_count
-------------
          12
(1 row)
```

---

### Step 5: Verify Database Schema ‚úÖ

Run these verification queries in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- 1. Check all tables exist
SELECT table_name,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = t.table_name) as column_count
FROM information_schema.tables t
WHERE table_schema='public'
AND (table_name LIKE 'quiz%' OR table_name LIKE 'exercise%' OR table_name LIKE 'workshop%')
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 2. Verify RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND (tablename LIKE 'quiz%' OR tablename LIKE 'exercise%' OR tablename LIKE 'workshop%');
-- All should show 't' (true) for rowsecurity

-- 3. Check indexes were created
SELECT indexname, tablename
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND (tablename LIKE 'quiz%' OR tablename LIKE 'exercise%' OR tablename LIKE 'workshop%')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;
-- Should show 15+ indexes

-- 4. Verify functions exist
SELECT proname, pronargs
FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname IN ('calculate_quiz_score', 'award_activity_points', 'update_updated_at_column');
-- Should return 3 functions

-- 5. Check policies exist
SELECT tablename, policyname
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND (tablename LIKE 'quiz%' OR tablename LIKE 'exercise%' OR tablename LIKE 'workshop%')
ORDER BY tablename;
-- Should return 20+ policies
```

---

### Step 6: Create Sample Quiz Data üìù

**Create a test quiz to verify system works:**

```sql
-- 1. Create a test quiz bank
INSERT INTO quiz_banks (
  course_id,
  title,
  description,
  difficulty_level,
  pass_percentage,
  time_limit_minutes,
  max_attempts,
  is_published
) VALUES (
  1, -- Replace with actual course_id
  'Test Quiz: System Verification',
  'This is a test quiz to verify the quiz system is working correctly',
  'beginner',
  70,
  10,
  3,
  true
) RETURNING id;

-- Copy the returned ID for next steps
-- Let's say it returns: '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'

-- 2. Add a multiple choice question
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (
  quiz_bank_id,
  question_text,
  question_type,
  points,
  explanation,
  order_index
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000', -- Use ID from step 1
  'What is 2 + 2?',
  'multiple_choice',
  1,
  '2 + 2 equals 4',
  0
) RETURNING id;

-- Copy the returned question ID
-- Let's say it returns: '660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001'

-- 3. Add options for the question
INSERT INTO quiz_options (question_id, option_text, is_correct, order_index) VALUES
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', '3', false, 0),
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', '4', true, 1),
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', '5', false, 2),
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001', '6', false, 3);

-- 4. Add a true/false question
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (
  quiz_bank_id,
  question_text,
  question_type,
  points,
  explanation,
  order_index
) VALUES (
  '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000',
  'The sky is blue.',
  'true_false',
  1,
  'Yes, the sky appears blue due to Rayleigh scattering',
  1
) RETURNING id;

-- Copy the returned ID
-- Let's say: '660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002'

-- 5. Add true/false options
INSERT INTO quiz_options (question_id, option_text, is_correct, order_index) VALUES
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002', 'True', true, 0),
  ('660e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440002', 'False', false, 1);

-- 6. Verify the quiz was created
SELECT
  qb.title,
  qb.is_published,
  COUNT(qq.id) as question_count,
  SUM(qq.points) as total_points
FROM quiz_banks qb
LEFT JOIN quiz_questions qq ON qq.quiz_bank_id = qb.id
WHERE qb.title = 'Test Quiz: System Verification'
GROUP BY qb.id, qb.title, qb.is_published;

-- Should show: 1 quiz, 2 questions, 2 total points
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Issue: Migration fails with "relation already exists"

**Solution:** Tables already exist, check if previous migration ran

```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name LIKE 'quiz%';
```

### Issue: RLS blocks all access

**Solution:** Check policies exist and user is enrolled

```sql
-- Check enrollment
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' AND course_id = YOUR_COURSE_ID;

-- Check policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'quiz_banks';
```

### Issue: Quiz doesn't appear in list

**Solution:** Check if published and enrollment

```sql
-- Check quiz status
SELECT id, title, is_published, course_id FROM quiz_banks;

-- Check if user is enrolled in that course
SELECT * FROM enrollments WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' AND course_id = THE_COURSE_ID;
```

### Issue: Points not awarded

**Solution:** Check learning_activity_points table

```sql
SELECT * FROM learning_activity_points WHERE activity_type = 'quiz' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### Issue: Frontend build fails

**Solution:** Check TypeScript errors

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
```
