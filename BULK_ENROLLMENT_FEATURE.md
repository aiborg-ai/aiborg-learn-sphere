## 🚨 Error Handling

### Common Errors & Solutions

#### 1. "User not found with email: xxx"

**Cause:** The email doesn't exist in the profiles table **Solution:** Ensure the user has an
account first, or fix the email address

#### 2. "User already enrolled in course X"

**Cause:** Duplicate enrollment detected **Solution:** This is not an error - the system skips it
automatically

#### 3. "Missing required headers"

**Cause:** CSV is missing one or more required columns **Solution:** Add all required columns:
email, course_id, payment_amount, payment_status, payment_method

#### 4. "Invalid email format"

**Cause:** Email doesn't match the pattern user@domain.com **Solution:** Correct the email address
format

#### 5. "Course ID must be a positive number"

**Cause:** Course ID is not a valid number or is negative/zero **Solution:** Use only positive
integers for course IDs

## 📊 Performance

### Processing Speed

- **Small Batch (<50):** ~30 seconds
- **Medium Batch (50-100):** ~1-2 minutes
- **Large Batch (100-500):** ~5-10 minutes

### Batch Size

- **Default:** 10 enrollments per batch
- **Delay:** 500ms between batches
- **Prevents:** Server timeouts and database locks

### Limits

- **Max File Size:** 5MB (recommended)
- **Max Rows:** 1000 per upload (recommended)
- **No Hard Limit:** Can process more, but may take longer

---

## 🔒 Security & Audit

### Access Control

- ✅ Admin-only feature
- ✅ Requires admin role in profiles table
- ✅ RLS policies enforced

### Audit Logging

Every bulk enrollment creates audit logs:

- Admin user who performed the operation
- Timestamp of operation
- Number of enrollments processed
- Source marked as "bulk_upload"

### Data Integrity

- ✅ Duplicate prevention (unique constraint)
- ✅ Transaction-safe operations
- ✅ Rollback on critical errors
- ✅ Payment transaction records created

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Sample Test Data

Use the provided **`bulk_enrollment_sample.csv`** file in the project root:

```csv
email,course_id,payment_amount,payment_status,payment_method
test.student1@example.com,1,99.99,completed,card
test.student2@example.com,1,99.99,pending,upi
test.student3@example.com,2,149.99,completed,bank
```

### Test Scenarios

1. **Happy Path:** All valid data processes successfully
2. **Validation Errors:** Invalid emails, negative amounts, wrong enums
3. **Duplicate Detection:** Re-uploading same users
4. **Missing Users:** Emails not in system
5. **Large Batch:** 100+ enrollments
