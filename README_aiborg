  📊 Prioritization Matrix

  Immediate (Next Sprint):
 
 
  -
before starting the assessment, do get some profilling questions from the user so that you can set the assessement questions better, for example, we have got 4 audience groups- young learners, teenagers, professionals and SMEs, so we shall start with that and get some more information and set the standard of assessment accordingly.


  Mid-term (3-6 months):
  - 
  - Interactive coding environment
  - Gamification
  - Mobile app
  - Advanced assessments

  Long-term (6-12 months):
  - Microservices architecture
  - AR/VR features
  - Blockchain certificates
  - Virtual labs
  - Full LMS integration

Immediate Next Steps

  1. Start a New Feature

  Use the spec-driven workflow:
  /specify <describe your feature>
  This will create a spec, branch, and guide you through /plan → /tasks →
  /implement

  2. Analyze Existing Code

  Need to understand something in the codebase?
  /analyze <what you want to understand>

  3. Clarify Requirements

  Have ambiguous requirements to work through?
  /clarify <what needs clarification>

  4. Regular Development

  Continue normal work - I can help with:
  - Bug fixes
  - Refactoring
  - Code reviews
  - Testing
  - Deployment

  5. Review Templates (Optional)

  You could review and align the Specify templates with your constitution:
  - .specify/templates/spec-template.md
  - .specify/templates/plan-template.md
  - .specify/templates/tasks-template.md

  Example: Starting a New Feature

  If you wanted to add something like "live video streaming for classes":
  /specify Add live video streaming capability for instructors to conduct
  real-time classes with student participation

  Then follow with /plan, /tasks, and /implement.












---------------------
can you please create pages for users, where in they can see which courses they have registered, course achivements and badges, course materials, can you also create a user type "Instructor"  who can upload the course work and "admin" user who can manage various users their courses and their progress etc.
