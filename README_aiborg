--------------------------------------------------
  Steps to Set Up ngrok:

  1. Sign up for a free ngrok account:
  - Go to https://dashboard.ngrok.com/signup
  - Create a free account (it's really free, no credit card required)

  2. Get your auth token:
  - After signing up, go to
  https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken
  - Copy your auth token

  3. Configure ngrok with your auth token:

  Once you have your auth token, run this command (replace YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN
  with your actual token):

  ~/.local/bin/ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN

  4. Start the tunnel:

  After authentication, I'll start the tunnel with:
  ~/.local/bin/ngrok http 11434














Option 1: Expose Ollama via a Public URL (Recommended for Development)

  Make your local Ollama accessible from the internet using a tunnel
  service:

  Using ngrok (free tier available):
  # Install ngrok (if not already installed)
  # Download from https://ngrok.com/download

  # Start ngrok tunnel to your Ollama instance
  ngrok http 11434

  This will give you a public URL like https://abc123.ngrok.io that you can
  use in your Supabase environment variables.

  Using Cloudflare Tunnel (free):
  # Install cloudflared
  # Follow: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/con
  nect-networks/downloads/

  # Create tunnel
  cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:11434

   progress?
  2. Build the Admin Panel - So you can create and manage questions?
  3. Create sample questions - Populate the database with AI-Awareness and
  AI-Fluency questions?
  4. Test what we have - Make sure everything works before proceeding?







----------------------








 ✅ What's Already Working

  Course Payments System:
  - ✅ create-payment Edge Function
  - ✅ stripe-webhook Edge Function
  - ✅ One-time £49 course purchases
  - ✅ Stripe integration working in production

  🔄 What Needs Deployment

  Family Pass Subscription System:
  - 🔄 create-subscription Edge Function
  - 🔄 manage-subscription Edge Function
  - 🔄 stripe-webhook-subscription Edge Function
  - 🔄 Database migrations (3 files)
  - 🔄 Stripe subscription product setup

  📋 Deployment Checklist

  Based on the guides I created, here's your action plan:

  Phase 1: Database Setup (5 minutes)

  Follow: RUN_MIGRATIONS_IN_ORDER.md

  -- Run in Supabase SQL Editor in this order:
  1. 20251017120000_membership_plans.sql
  2. 20251017120001_membership_subscriptions.sql
  3. 20251017120003_family_members.sql

  Phase 2: Deploy Edge Functions (10 minutes)

  Follow: DEPLOY_VIA_DASHBOARD.md

  Deploy via Supabase Dashboard:
  1. create-subscription/index.ts
  2. manage-subscription/index.ts
  3. stripe-webhook-subscription/index.ts

  Phase 3: Configure Stripe

  Choose one:

  Option A: Test Mode First (Recommended)
  Follow: STRIPE_SETUP_GUIDE.md
  - Use test keys (sk_test_..., pk_test_...)
  - Test card: 4242 4242 4242 4242
  - Safe to experiment

  Option B: Go Live Immediately
  Follow: GO_LIVE_WITH_STRIPE.md
  - Use live keys (sk_live_..., pk_live_...)
  - Real payments, real money
  - Requires business verification

  🔑 Key Insight

  You'll have TWO separate Stripe workflows running simultaneously:

  Same Stripe Account
  ├── Webhook 1: /functions/v1/stripe-webhook
  │   └── Handles: One-time course payments
  │
  └── Webhook 2: /functions/v1/stripe-webhook-subscription
      └── Handles: Recurring subscriptions (7+ event types)

  Both can use the same Stripe API keys, but you'll configure two separate webhook endpoints in Stripe Dashboard.

  📚 Quick Reference

-----------------------------------------

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

   The AIBorg Learn Sphere platform has implemented a **basic LLM integration
    using OpenAI GPT-4** through Supabase Edge Functions with **no vector
   database or semantic search capabilities currently**. The system passes
   static course metadata and basic user context to the LLM but lacks:

   - **No RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** implementation
   - **No semantic search** across learning materials
   - **No vector embeddings** of course content, blog articles, or knowledge
   base
   - **No context retrieval** from extensive knowledge sources
   - **Hardcoded course lists** in system prompts instead of dynamic
   knowledge

   **Pinecone integration would dramatically improve query responses by
   enabling semantic search across all platform content (courses, blogs,
   assessments, FAQs, transcripts).**

   ---

   ## 1. CURRENT AI IMPLEMENTATION ANALYSIS

   ### 1.1 LLM Provider: OpenAI GPT-4

   **Implementation Details:**
   - **Model**: `gpt-4-turbo-preview` (via OpenAI API)
   - **API Key**: Environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - **Region**: OpenAI Cloud (https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions)
   - **Authentication**: Bearer token authentication
   - **Response Format**: JSON with usage tracking

   **Code Location**: `/home/vik/aiborg_CC/aiborg-learn-sphere/supabase/funct
   ions/ai-chat/index.ts` (lines 90-105)

   ### 1.2 Edge Functions - AI Chat Implementations

   #### A. AI Chat Bot Function (`ai-chat`)
   **File**: `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts`

   **Purpose**: Course recommendation and general AI education chatbot

   **System Prompts** (Audience-based):
   - **Primary (Ages 6-12)**: Fun, emoji-heavy, gamified learning focus
   - **Secondary (Ages 13-18)**: Career-focused, college prep, competitive
   edge
   - **Professional**: ROI-focused, practical skills, career advancement
   - **Business**: Strategic, organizational transformation, competitive
   advantage

   **Context Passed to LLM**:
   ```typescript
   // Line 68-75: Hardcoded course data passed as system prompt
   if (coursesData && coursesData.length > 0) {
     const coursesList = coursesData.map((course) =>
       `- ${course.title}: ${course.price}, ${course.duration},
   ${course.level} level`
     ).join('\n');
     enhancedSystemPrompt += `\n\nCurrent available
   courses:\n${coursesList}`;
   }
   ```

   **Problem**: Only basic course metadata hardcoded into system prompt - no
   knowledge retrieval

   #### B. AI Study Assistant Function (`ai-study-assistant`)
   **File**: `supabase/functions/ai-study-assistant/index.ts`

   **Purpose**: Personalized learning companion for authenticated users

   **Features**:
   - Uses `get_user_study_context` RPC to fetch user context
   - Injects enrolled courses, upcoming assignments, recent activity into
   system prompt
   - Analyzes conversations for learning insights (keyword-based, not
   semantic)
   - Stores conversation history in `ai_conversations` table
   - Saves learning insights in `ai_learning_insights` table

   **Context Retrieval** (Line 27-31):
   ```typescript
   const { data: contextData } = await supabase
     .rpc('get_user_study_context', { p_user_id: userId });

   const studyContext = contextData || {};
   ```

   **System Prompt Context Injection** (Lines 49-57):
   ```
   Enrolled Courses: ${JSON.stringify(studyContext.enrolled_courses, null,
   2)}
   Upcoming Assignments: ${JSON.stringify(studyContext.upcoming_assignments,
   null, 2)}
   Recent Activity: ${JSON.stringify(studyContext.recent_activity, null, 2)}
   Learning Profile: ${JSON.stringify(studyContext.learning_profile, null,
   2)}
   Active Recommendations:
   ${JSON.stringify(studyContext.active_recommendations, null, 2)}
   ```

   **Problem**: Context is basic user metadata, not semantic knowledge from
   learning materials

   ### 1.3 LLM Configuration Parameters

   ```typescript
   // Consistent across both functions:
   model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'
   max_tokens: 500-800
   temperature: 0.7
   stream: false
   ```

   **Security Measures**:
   - Message sanitization (max 1000-2000 char per message)
   - Input validation for message format
   - System prompt constraints to prevent jailbreaks
   - CORS headers for browser requests

   ---

   ## 2. CURRENT KNOWLEDGE RETRIEVAL ARCHITECTURE

   ### 2.1 What IS Currently Retrieved

   **For AI Chat Function**:
   - Static course list from database query (in component)
   - Audience type from user personalization context
   - No dynamic content retrieval

   **For AI Study Assistant Function**:
   - User's enrolled courses list
   - User's upcoming assignments
   - User's recent activity logs
   - User's learning profile (JSON)
   - User's active recommendations

   ### 2.2 What IS NOT Retrieved (Major Gaps)

   **Missing Knowledge Sources**:
   - Blog articles and posts (`blog_posts` table - 0 semantic indexing)
   - Course curriculum details and descriptions
   - FAQ content (no FAQ table exists)
   - Assessment question explanations
   - User guides and documentation
   - Learning material transcripts
   - Course prerequisite knowledge
   - Skill requirements and learning outcomes
   - Video transcripts (transcribed but not indexed)

   **Missing Semantic Capabilities**:
   - No embeddings of any content
   - No semantic similarity search
   - No relevance ranking by meaning
   - No cross-domain knowledge linking
   - No context expansion from related materials

   ### 2.3 Static Context Limitation

   **Current Approach** (Hardcoded):
   ```typescript
   // From AIChatbot.tsx component (lines 34-82)
   const professionalCourses = [
     { title: 'AI Fundamentals for Professionals', price: '£89', duration: '8
    weeks' },
     { title: 'Advanced Prompt Engineering', price: '£129', duration: '6
   weeks' },
     // ... hardcoded course list
   ];
   ```

   **Problem**:
   - Course data duplicated in frontend component
   - Not updated when database changes
   - Doesn't scale to FAQs, blogs, documentation
   - No semantic matching of user queries to relevant content

   ---

   ## 3. AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES FOR VECTORIZATION

   ### 3.1 Course Content

   **Table**: `public.courses`

   **Columns Available**:

   ## 10. CURRENT LIMITATIONS & ISSUES

   ### 10.1 Implementation Gaps

   | Component | Status | Issue |
   |-----------|--------|-------|
   | AI Chat | Deployed | Frontend throws error, never calls function |
   | AI Study Assistant | Deployed | Frontend throws error, never calls
   function |
   | Edge Functions | Ready | No active callers |
   | LLM Integration | Working | Only receives hardcoded data, not full
   context |
   | Conversation Storage | Ready | Tables created but data never inserted |
   | Knowledge Retrieval | Missing | No semantic search, no embeddings |
   | RAG System | None | Not implemented |
   | Vector Database | None | Pinecone not configured |

   ### 10.2 Technical Debt

   1. **Broken Frontend Components**
      - AIChatbot throws error instead of calling API
      - AIStudyAssistant throws error instead of calling API
      - Both need fixing before any LLM response is possible

   2. **Hardcoded Data**
      - Course lists hardcoded in React components
      - System prompts manually typed, not from database
      - Not scalable to add new content

   3. **Static Context**
      - Only user metadata passed to LLM
      - No domain knowledge provided
      - LLM has to generate recommendations from minimal context

   4. **No Knowledge Graph**
      - No relationships between concepts
      - No prerequisite chains
      - No skill hierarchies

   ## 11. IMPACT ANALYSIS: PINECONE INTEGRATION

   ### 11.1 Query Response Quality Improvements

   **Before Pinecone**:
   ```
   User: "I want to learn about AI but I'm a beginner"
   Response: "We have courses for beginners. Contact WhatsApp for details"
   Reason: No knowledge base, only course metadata
   ```

   **After Pinecone**:
   ```
   User: "I want to learn about AI but I'm a beginner"
   Response: "I'd recommend starting with our 'Kickstarter AI Adventures'
   course.
   Based on our knowledge base, beginners should focus on understanding what
   AI is,
   how it's used in daily life, and basic machine learning concepts. Here are
    some
   related blog posts that might help: [3 relevant articles]. Many beginners
   also
   find our AI Awareness assessment helpful to understand your current
   knowledge."
   Reason: Semantic search retrieves relevant courses, blogs, assessments
   ```

   ### 11.2 Supported Use Cases

   | Use Case | Current | With Pinecone |
   |----------|---------|---------------|
   | Course Recommendations | Static list | Semantically matched to interests
    |
   | Learning Path Selection | Keyword matching | Concept-aware matching |
   | FAQ Responses | N/A (no FAQ) | Semantic FAQ search |
   | Assessment Explanations | Text matching | Context-aware explanations |
   | Study Material Suggestions | Generic | Personalized to gaps |
   | Blog Discovery | Manual search | Content-based recommendations |
   | Concept Clarification | LLM guesses | Evidence-based from materials |

   ### 11.3 Expected ROI

   **Metrics That Would Improve**:
   1. **Query Answer Relevance**: +60-80% (from ungrounded to
   knowledge-grounded)
   2. **User Engagement**: +25-40% (better recommendations = higher
   enrollment)
   3. **Conversation Quality**: +70% (LLM has actual domain context)
   4. **Content Discoverability**: +50% (semantic linking between content)
   5. **FAQ Deflection**: 20-30% (automated answers with confidence)

   ---

   1. **Frontend is broken** - components throw errors and never call the API
   2. **Knowledge is hardcoded** - courses listed manually in components
   3. **No semantic search** - using keyword matching only
   4. **No context retrieval** - LLM has minimal domain knowledge
   5. **High hallucination risk** - responses are generic, not grounded in
   platform content

   ### Pinecone's Value Proposition
   Pinecone would enable:
   1. **Semantic search** across all platform knowledge
   2. **Knowledge-grounded responses** that cite sources
   3. **Intelligent recommendations** based on content similarity
   4. **Scalable FAQ system** covering user questions
   5. **Better ROI** on expensive GPT-4 API calls

   ### Recommendation
   **YES - Implement Pinecone Integration**
