# üöÄ Deploy 500 Blog Articles via Supabase Dashboard

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Database Connection Issue

The command-line scripts can't connect to the database. This is normal - Supabase often requires
dashboard access for security.

**Solution:** Use the Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor instead (actually easier!)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Fix Author Constraint (1 minute)

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: **aiborg-learn-sphere**
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste this:

```sql
-- Make author_id nullable so blog posts can exist without an author
ALTER TABLE blog_posts ALTER COLUMN author_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. ‚úÖ Should see "Success" message

---

### Step 2: Deploy Batch 1 (2 minutes)

1. In your terminal, run:

```bash
cat /home/vik/aiborg_CC/aiborg-learn-sphere/scripts/blog_inserts/batch_01_blog_articles.sql
```

2. **Select ALL the output** (it will be long - ~50 articles)
3. Copy it (Ctrl+C)
4. Go back to Supabase SQL Editor
5. Click **New Query**
6. Paste the SQL (Ctrl+V)
7. Click **Run**
8. Wait ~30 seconds
9. ‚úÖ Should see "Success. No rows returned"

---

### Step 3: Repeat for Batches 2-10

**Repeat the same process for each batch:**

```bash
# Batch 2
cat /home/vik/aiborg_CC/aiborg-learn-sphere/scripts/blog_inserts/batch_02_blog_articles.sql

# Batch 3
cat /home/vik/aiborg_CC/aiborg-learn-sphere/scripts/blog_inserts/batch_03_blog_articles.sql

# ... continue through batch_10
```

For each batch:

1. Cat the file in terminal
2. Copy all output
3. Paste in new SQL Editor query
4. Run
5. Wait for success

**Total Time:** ~20 minutes (2 minutes per batch)

---

## üí° Quick Tips

### Make it Faster:

**Option A: Open multiple tabs**

- Open 3-4 Supabase SQL Editor tabs
- Prepare multiple batches at once
- Run them in parallel
- Reduces time to ~10 minutes

**Option B: Combine batches**

- Cat 2-3 batches together
- Copy the combined output
- Run larger batches
- Fewer copy-paste cycles

---

## üîç Verify Deployment

After each batch, you can check progress:

```sql
-- Check total count
SELECT COUNT(*) as total FROM blog_posts;

-- Check by category
SELECT
    bc.name as category,
    COUNT(bp.id) as posts
FROM blog_categories bc
LEFT JOIN blog_posts bp ON bc.id = bp.category_id
GROUP BY bc.name
ORDER BY posts DESC;
```

**Expected counts:**

- After batch 1: ~50 posts
- After batch 2: ~100 posts
- After batch 5: ~250 posts
- After batch 10: ~500 posts

---

## üéØ Final Verification

After deploying all 10 batches:

### 1. Check Database

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts;
-- Should show ~500

SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM blog_posts GROUP BY status;
-- Should show mostly 'published' status
```

### 2. Check Admin Dashboard

1. Go to: https://www.aiborg.ai/admin
2. Click **Blog Management** tab
3. ‚úÖ Should see **~500 total posts**
4. ‚úÖ Pagination controls visible
5. ‚úÖ Can navigate through pages

### 3. Check Public Blog

1. Go to: https://www.aiborg.ai/blog
2. ‚úÖ Should see articles
3. ‚úÖ Categories populated
4. ‚úÖ Can filter and search

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### SQL Editor shows error

- Check you ran Step 1 (ALTER TABLE) first
- If duplicate slug errors appear, that's OK (articles already exist)
- Errors about author_id? Re-run Step 1

### Can't find SQL Editor

- Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí SQL Editor (left sidebar)
- Or go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/sql

### Query too large error

- Split the batch into 2 parts
- Copy first half of batch file, run it
- Copy second half, run it

### Still only shows 12 posts

- Clear browser cache
- Refresh admin dashboard
- Check pagination controls are visible
- Try changing page size to 100 or 500
