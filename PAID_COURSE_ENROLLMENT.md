# Paid Course Enrollment Flow - Complete Implementation

## Overview
Users can enroll in paid courses with secure Stripe payment processing. After successful payment, the course is **immediately available** in their Learning Management System.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

```
User ‚Üí Enrollment Form ‚Üí Stripe Checkout ‚Üí Webhook ‚Üí Auto-Enrollment ‚Üí Dashboard Access
```

### Components Created/Modified

#### 1. **Stripe Webhook Handler** (NEW)
**File**: `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts`

**Purpose**: Automatically creates enrollment when payment succeeds

**How it works**:
1. Listens for `checkout.session.completed` events from Stripe
2. Verifies webhook signature for security
3. Extracts course and user info from metadata
4. Finds user in database (checks both `profiles` and `auth.users`)
5. Finds course by ID (or fallback to name search)
6. Checks for duplicate enrollments
7. Creates enrollment record with:
   - `payment_status: 'completed'`
   - `payment_amount`: actual amount paid
   - `payment_session_id`: Stripe session ID for reference
8. Triggers invoice generation
9. Returns success response

**Environment Variables Required**:
- `STRIPE_KEY` - Stripe secret key
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` - Webhook signing secret (from Stripe Dashboard)
- `SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - Service role key (for admin operations)

#### 2. **Enhanced EnrollmentForm**
**File**: `src/components/EnrollmentForm.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Added `courseId` prop for accurate course identification
- Passes `courseId` to payment function
- Dual-path logic: Free courses ‚Üí direct enrollment, Paid courses ‚Üí Stripe

#### 3. **Enhanced Payment Creation**
**File**: `supabase/functions/create-payment/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- Accepts `courseId` parameter
- Includes `courseId` in Stripe session metadata
- Metadata now includes:
  - `courseName` (display name)
  - `courseId` (database ID)
  - `studentName` (for records)
  - `email` (for user lookup)

#### 4. **Improved PaymentSuccess Page**
**File**: `src/pages/PaymentSuccess.tsx`

**Changes**:
- Shows "Course Access Granted" message
- Displays immediate access information
- Auto-redirects to dashboard (8 seconds)
- Large "Go to My Dashboard" button
- Dynamic countdown timer
- User-aware redirect logic

## Complete User Flow

### Paid Course Enrollment Process

1. **Course Selection**
   - User browses training programs
   - Identifies paid course (price displayed)
   - Clicks "Enroll Now"

2. **Enrollment Form**
   - User fills out:
     - Student name

4. **Stripe Webhook (Background)**
   - Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` event
   - `stripe-webhook` function receives event
   - Verifies signature
   - Extracts metadata (courseId, email, etc.)
   - Looks up user in database
   - Creates enrollment record
   - Triggers invoice generation

5. **Payment Success**
   - User redirected to `/payment-success` page
   - Sees confirmation message
   - Countdown timer showing 8 seconds
   - "Go to My Dashboard" button available
   - Auto-redirects to dashboard

6. **Immediate Course Access**
   - Dashboard shows enrolled course
   - Course materials available
   - Progress tracking begins
   - Full LMS access granted

## Database Schema

### Enrollment Record
```sql
INSERT INTO enrollments (
  user_id,          -- UUID from auth.users
  course_id,        -- Integer course ID
  payment_status,   -- 'completed'
  payment_amount,   -- Actual amount in base currency
  payment_session_id -- Stripe session ID
)
```

### Key Fields
- `payment_status`: Always 'completed' after successful payment
- `payment_amount`: Amount paid (converted from cents)
- `payment_session_id`: Reference to Stripe session for refunds/tracking

## Webhook Setup Instructions

### 1. Deploy Webhook Function
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard ‚Üí Developers ‚Üí Webhooks
2. Click "Add endpoint"
3. Enter URL: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
4. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`
5. Copy webhook signing secret
6. Add to Supabase secrets:
```bash
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in Supabase:
```bash
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_KEY=sk_live_...
npx supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```
