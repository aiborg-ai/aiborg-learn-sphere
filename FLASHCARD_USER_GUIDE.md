## 🧠 What is Spaced Repetition?

Spaced repetition is a learning technique that presents information at increasing intervals over time. Instead of cramming, you review material just as you're about to forget it, leading to:

- **25% better retention** compared to traditional studying
- **Faster learning** with less total study time
- **Long-term memory formation** that lasts years, not days

Our system uses the **SM-2 algorithm** (the same one used by Anki), which has been scientifically proven to optimize learning efficiency.

### How It Works

1. **New cards** are reviewed after 1 day
2. If you remember, the next review is after **6 days**
3. Each successful review **doubles or triples** the interval
4. Cards you struggle with are shown **more frequently**
5. Easy cards appear **less often**, saving you time

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Step 1: Navigate to Flashcards

1. Log into your Aiborg Learn Sphere account
2. Click on **"Flashcards"** in the navigation menu
3. You'll see the main flashcard dashboard

### Step 2: Understand the Dashboard

The dashboard shows:
- **Your Streak** - Days in a row you've reviewed (🔥 keep it going!)
- **All Your Decks** - Collections of flashcards organized by topic
- **Stats** - Total cards, due cards, and progress

---

## 📝 Creating Your First Deck

A **deck** is a collection of flashcards on a specific topic (e.g., "Spanish Vocabulary", "Python Basics").

### Creating a Deck

1. Click the **"New Deck"** button (top right)
2. Enter a **title** (required)
   - Good: "Spanish Verbs - Present Tense"
   - Bad: "Spanish" (too broad)
3. Add a **description** (optional but recommended)
   - Example: "Common Spanish verbs in present tense conjugation"
4. Click **"Create Deck"**

### Deck Visibility

- **Private** (default) - Only you can see and use this deck
- **Public** - Other users can view and study from your deck (coming soon)

### Tips for Organizing Decks

- ✅ **One topic per deck** - "French Vocabulary" not "All Languages"
- ✅ **Specific subtopics** - "JavaScript Arrays" not "All of JavaScript"
- ✅ **100-500 cards** - Optimal deck size for daily reviews
- ❌ Avoid mixing unrelated topics in one deck

---

## ✏️ Adding Flashcards

### Creating a Flashcard

1. Click on a deck to open it
2. Click **"Add Card"** button
3. Fill in the card:
   - **Front (Question)** - What you want to remember
   - **Back (Answer)** - The information you're learning
   - **Tags** (optional) - For organization (e.g., "irregular, common")
4. Click **"Create Card"**

### Flashcard Examples

#### ✅ Good Flashcards

**Example 1: Language Learning**
- Front: "How do you say 'hello' in Spanish?"
- Back: "Hola"
- Tags: greeting, common

**Example 2: Programming**
- Front: "What does .map() return in JavaScript?"
- Back: "A new array with transformed elements"
- Tags: arrays, methods

**Example 3: History**
- Front: "When did World War II end?"
- Back: "September 2, 1945"
- Tags: wwii, dates

#### ❌ Poor Flashcards

**Too Complex:**
- Front: "Explain the entire history of Ancient Rome"
- Back: [5 paragraphs]
- Problem: Too much information, impossible to review quickly

**Too Vague:**
- Front: "Important date?"
- Back: "1945"
- Problem: No context, you won't know what you're remembering

**Multiple Questions:**
- Front: "What are lists, tuples, and dictionaries in Python?"
- Back: [Three different concepts]
- Problem: Split into 3 separate cards

### Flashcard Best Practices

1. **One concept per card** - Break complex topics into multiple cards
2. **Keep it short** - Front and back should be 1-2 sentences max
3. **Be specific** - "Capital of France?" not "France?"
4. **Add context** - Include enough info to understand the question
5. **Use examples** - Show real usage, not just definitions

## 🎯 Reviewing Flashcards

This is where the magic happens! Regular reviews are the key to long-term retention.

### Starting a Review Session

1. Navigate to a deck
2. Look for the **"due for review"** badge
3. Click **"Start Review"**
4. You'll see how many cards are due

### Review Interface

#### The Flashcard
- **Front side** shows the question
- Click the card or press **Space** to flip
- **Back side** reveals the answer

#### Rate Your Recall

After flipping, you'll see 4 buttons:

1. **Again** (Red) ⭕
   - You completely forgot
   - Card will be shown again soon
   - Interval: ~10 minutes

2. **Hard** (Orange) ⚠️
   - You remembered with difficulty
   - Card interval increases slightly
   - Interval: ~1-3 days

3. **Good** (Green) ✓
   - You remembered correctly
   - Normal interval increase
   - Interval: ~3-7 days

4. **Easy** (Blue) ⭐
   - Perfect recall, instant answer
   - Longer interval
   - Interval: ~7-14 days

### Review Progress

- **Progress bar** shows cards remaining
- **Counter** displays current position (e.g., "5 / 20")
- **Streak** displayed if you have an active streak

### Completion

After reviewing all due cards:
- 🏆 **Completion screen** appears
- Your **streak** is updated
- Stats are saved for analytics

---

## 💯 Understanding Review Quality

The quality of your rating dramatically affects your learning efficiency.

### When to Press "Again" (1)

- You had **no idea** what the answer was
- You confused it with something else
- You got it **completely wrong**
- You want to see this card **again today**

**Effect:** Resets the card, you'll see it very soon

### When to Press "Hard" (2)

- You remembered but it took **significant effort**
- You had to **think for 10+ seconds**
- You got it partially right
- You want to see this card **more often**

**Effect:** Slight interval increase, card is marked as difficult

### When to Press "Good" (3)

- You remembered with **minor hesitation** (2-5 seconds)
- You got it **correct**
- This is your **default choice** for most reviews
- You want the **normal** review schedule

**Effect:** Standard interval increase (algorithm default)

### When to Press "Easy" (4)

- **Instant recall**, no thinking required
- You knew it **before seeing the back**
- The card feels **too easy** for you
- You want to see it **much later**

**Effect:** Maximum interval increase, card scheduled far in future

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

❌ **Being too harsh** - Using "Again" when "Hard" is appropriate
- Result: You waste time reviewing cards you actually know

❌ **Being too generous** - Using "Easy" when you hesitated
- Result: Cards come back too late and you forget

✅ **Best approach**:
- Use "Good" (3) for 70% of cards
- Use "Again" only when genuinely stuck
- Save "Easy" for cards that feel trivial

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

Power users can review much faster with keyboard shortcuts!

### Essential Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Space` or `Enter` | Flip card |
| `1` | Rate as "Again" |
| `2` | Rate as "Hard" |
| `3` | Rate as "Good" |
| `4` | Rate as "Easy" |

### Workflow Example

1. Read question
2. Think of answer
3. Press `Space` to flip
4. Press `3` if correct (or `1`, `2`, `4` as needed)
5. Repeat!

### Speed Tips

- Keep your hands on the keyboard
- Use number keys for rating (don't click)
- Develop a rhythm: Space → think → number → repeat
- Aim for 10-15 cards per minute once proficient

## 📊 Tracking Your Progress

### Streak System

Your **streak** shows consecutive days you've reviewed flashcards.

**Benefits of streaks:**
- Builds a daily learning habit
- Provides motivation to keep going
- Displayed prominently with 🔥 emoji

**Maintaining your streak:**
- Review **at least 1 card** per day
- Review doesn't have to be perfect
- Even quick 5-minute sessions count

**What breaks a streak:**
- Not reviewing for a full day (24 hours)
- Dismissing all cards without reviewing
- Having 0 cards due doesn't break streak

### Stats You'll See

- **Current Streak** - Days in a row (e.g., 🔥 7 day streak)
- **Longest Streak** - Your personal best
- **Total Review Days** - Lifetime total days you've reviewed
- **Cards Due** - Number of cards ready to review
- **Total Cards** - Cards in each deck

### Analyzing Your Learning

Watch for these patterns:
- **Many "Again" ratings** → Cards might be too difficult, break into simpler concepts
- **All "Easy" ratings** → You've mastered this topic, consider harder material
- **Long intervals** → Your retention is excellent!
- **Short intervals** → You're still learning, keep reviewing regularly

## 🎓 Best Practices

### Daily Review Habits

**Optimal Review Schedule:**
- ⏰ **Same time daily** - Morning is best (fresh mind)
- ⏱️ **15-30 minutes** - Short, focused sessions
- 📱 **Make it convenient** - Install as PWA on phone
- ☕ **Pair with routine** - Review with morning coffee

**Weekly Goals:**
- Maintain your streak (review daily)
- Add 10-20 new cards per week
- Complete all due reviews each day
- Review totals: 50-100 cards per session

### Creating Effective Flashcards

**The 20 Rules of Knowledge Formulation:**

1. **Understand before memorizing**
   - Don't create cards for concepts you don't understand
   - Read/learn the material first, then create cards

2. **Use the minimum information principle**
   - Simplest question, simplest answer
   - One fact per card

3. **Use cloze deletion for lists**
   - Front: "The three branches of US government are: [...]"
   - Back: "Executive, Legislative, Judicial"

4. **Avoid enumeration**
   - Instead of "List 5 types of...", create 5 separate cards

5. **Combat interference**
   - Don't create similar cards that confuse each other
   - Example: Don't make cards for "French 'hello'" and "Spanish 'hello'" in the same deck

6. **Optimize wording**
   - Use clear, unambiguous language
   - Avoid pronouns (he, she, it, they)

7. **Use images when helpful**
   - Visual learners benefit from diagrams
   - Flags, maps, charts, diagrams

8. **Provide context**
   - Include enough info to trigger recall
   - "In Python, how do you..." not "How do you..."

### Deck Management

**When to create a new deck:**
- ✅ New major topic (e.g., switching from Python to Java)
- ✅ Different skill level (Beginner vs Advanced)
- ✅ Different learning goals (Exam prep vs Long-term retention)

**When to add to existing deck:**
- ✅ Related subtopics (JavaScript: arrays, objects, functions)
- ✅ Building on previous knowledge
- ✅ Same context/domain

**Deck maintenance:**
- 🗑️ **Delete bad cards** - If a card is confusing, delete and remake it
- ✏️ **Edit unclear cards** - Fix typos and improve wording
- 🏷️ **Use tags** - Organize cards within large decks
- 📊 **Review deck stats** - Retire decks you've mastered

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Creating too many cards at once**
- Start with 20-30 cards per deck
- Add more as you review consistently

❌ **Skipping reviews**
- Even 1 day off can break the rhythm
- Do quick 5-minute sessions if busy

❌ **Rating everything as "Easy"**
- Be honest with yourself
- Use "Good" as default, "Easy" rarely

❌ **Making cards too complex**
- Break down into atomic facts
- Simple questions, simple answers

❌ **Not reviewing regularly**
- Daily review is key to the algorithm
- Spaced repetition requires consistency

## ❓ FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How many cards should I study per day?**
A: Start with 20-30 new cards per day. Experienced users can handle 50-100. Quality over quantity!

**Q: What happens if I miss a day?**
A: Your streak resets, but your card progress is saved. Just continue reviewing the next day.

**Q: Can I share my decks with others?**
A: Public deck sharing is coming soon! Currently, decks are private.

**Q: How long until I see results?**
A: You'll notice improved retention within 2-3 weeks of consistent daily review.

**Q: What if I have too many due cards?**
A: Review what you can, the rest will remain due. Consider reducing new cards per day.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What algorithm does this use?**
A: We use the SM-2 algorithm, the same proven algorithm used by Anki (the most popular flashcard app).

**Q: How are intervals calculated?**
A:
- First review: 1 day
- Second review: 6 days
- Subsequent: previous interval × easiness factor
- Failed reviews reset to 1 day

**Q: What's the "easiness factor"?**
A: A number (1.3-2.5+) that represents how easy a card is for you. It increases when you rate "Easy" and decreases with "Again".

**Q: Can I export my cards?**
A: Export functionality is planned. For now, your cards are stored securely in our database.

**Q: Do flashcards work offline?**
A: With our PWA (Progressive Web App), you can review cards offline! Install the app from your browser.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: I don't see any cards to review**
A: No cards are due! Come back later when cards are scheduled for review. Add more cards if needed.

**Q: A card keeps appearing even though I rate it "Easy"**
A: If you previously struggled with the card, it may need several "Easy" ratings to extend the interval significantly.

**Q: How do I delete a card?**
A: Go to the deck, find the card, and click the trash icon. Be careful - this is permanent!

**Q: The keyboard shortcuts aren't working**
A: Make sure you're not typing in a text field. Click on the flashcard area first.

**Q: My streak says 0 but I reviewed yesterday**
A: Check your timezone settings. Streaks are based on calendar days in your timezone.

---

## 📈 Measuring Success

### What Good Progress Looks Like

After **1 week:**
- You've maintained a daily streak
- You have 50-100 cards created
- You're comfortable with the interface
- Reviews take 10-15 minutes daily

After **1 month:**
- 7+ day streak (preferably 30!)
- 200-300 cards in rotation
- You can recall 70%+ of cards correctly
- Intervals are increasing (cards showing less often)

After **3 months:**
- Consistent daily habit established
- 500+ cards mastered
- Retention rate above 85%
- Some cards not due for months (sign of mastery!)

### Red Flags

- ⚠️ Cards always showing at same interval (not improving)
- ⚠️ > 50% "Again" ratings (cards too difficult)
- ⚠️ Review sessions taking > 45 minutes (too many cards)
- ⚠️ Breaking streaks frequently (habit not formed)

**Solutions:**
- Delete or simplify difficult cards
- Reduce new cards per day
- Review in shorter, more frequent sessions
- Set a consistent daily alarm

---

**Happy Learning! 🎓**

Remember: Consistency beats intensity. 15 minutes daily is better than 2 hours once a week. Build the habit, trust the algorithm, and watch your retention soar!
