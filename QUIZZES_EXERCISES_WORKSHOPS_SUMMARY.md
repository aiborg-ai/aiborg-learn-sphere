## 🔐 Security (Row Level Security)

All tables have RLS enabled with policies for:

### Enrollment-Based Access

- ✅ Students can only access quizzes/exercises/workshops for enrolled courses
- ✅ Must be enrolled + content must be published

### Role-Based Management

- ✅ **Instructors** can manage content for their courses
- ✅ **Admins** can manage all content across all courses
- ✅ **Students** can view published content and manage their own attempts/submissions

### Privacy Protection

- ✅ Users can only view their own attempts, submissions, and workshop participation
- ✅ Users can only update their own in-progress/draft work
- ✅ Workshop participants can only see activities for sessions they're part of

---

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created

- Course relationships (quiz_banks, exercises, workshops by course_id)
- User lookups (attempts, submissions, participants by user_id)
- Status filtering (for active/completed tracking)
- Time-based queries (workshop scheduling)
- Activity type filtering (learning_activity_points)

**Total Indexes:** 15

---

## 🛠️ Helper Functions

### `calculate_quiz_score(attempt_id)`

- Automatically calculates quiz results
- Computes: score, total_points, percentage, pass/fail
- Updates quiz_attempts table
- Called after quiz completion

### `award_activity_points(user_id, activity_type, activity_id, points, reason)`

- Awards Aiborg points for completed activities
- Integrates with existing gamification system
- Tracks reason for point award

---

## 🔄 Automatic Triggers

- `update_updated_at_column()` - Auto-updates timestamps on:
  - quiz_banks
  - quiz_questions
  - exercises
  - exercise_submissions
  - workshops
  - workshop_sessions

---

## 📋 Enrollment Gates

All three systems enforce enrollment gates:

```sql
-- Example: User can only access if enrolled in course
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM public.enrollments
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND course_id = [activity].course_id
  AND payment_status = 'completed'
)
```

**Behavior:**

- Unenrolled users attempting to access → Redirect to course enrollment page
- Free courses → Instant enrollment
- Paid courses → Payment required first
