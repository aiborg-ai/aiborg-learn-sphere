## Critical Issues Found

### üî¥ Issue #1: ReferenceError - `personalization is not defined`

**Location:** `src/components/features/AIChatbot.tsx:282, 288`

**Description:** The code referenced `personalization.audience` but the variable `personalization`
was never defined. The correct variable from the `usePersonalization()` hook is `selectedAudience`.

**Impact:**

- Caused all chatbot queries to fail
- Forced fallback to static responses
- Prevented GPT-4 API calls from being made

**Root Cause:**

```typescript
// WRONG (lines 282, 288):
audience: personalization.audience,

// CORRECT:
audience: selectedAudience,
```

**Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ FIXED

```typescript
// Fixed in src/components/features/AIChatbot.tsx
const coursesData = getCourseRecommendations().map(course => ({
  title: course.title,
  price: course.price,
  duration: course.duration,
  level: course.level || 'beginner',
  audience: selectedAudience, // ‚úÖ FIXED
}));

const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('ai-chat', {
  body: {
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: userMessage }],
    audience: selectedAudience, // ‚úÖ FIXED
    coursesData: coursesData,
  },
});
```

### üî¥ Issue #2: CORS Error - Missing `x-application-name` header

**Location:** `supabase/functions/ai-chat/index.ts:6`

**Description:** The edge function's CORS configuration did not include the `x-application-name`
header in the allowed headers list. The Supabase JavaScript client automatically sends this header,
causing CORS preflight requests to fail.

**Error Message:**

```
Access to fetch at 'https://afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj.supabase.co/functions/v1/ai-chat'
from origin 'http://localhost:8080' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Request header field x-application-name is not allowed by
Access-Control-Allow-Headers in preflight response.
```

**Impact:**

- All API calls to the edge function fail
- Browser blocks requests before they reach the server
- Forces chatbot to use fallback responses

**Fix Applied:** ‚úÖ FIXED (code updated, needs deployment)

```typescript
// BEFORE:
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers': 'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type',
};

// AFTER:
const corsHeaders = {
  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*',
  'Access-Control-Allow-Headers':
    'authorization, x-client-info, apikey, content-type, x-application-name', // ‚úÖ ADDED
};
```

**Action Required:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **NEEDS DEPLOYMENT** The edge function needs to be redeployed to Supabase
for the fix to take effect.

**Deployment Options:**

Option 1: Via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj
2. Navigate to Edge Functions
3. Select `ai-chat` function
4. Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"

Option 2: Via Supabase CLI (if you have access token)

```bash
npx supabase functions deploy ai-chat --project-ref afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj
```

## Fallback System Analysis

### Fallback Triggers

The chatbot correctly falls back to static responses when:

1. Edge function fails (CORS error)
2. OpenAI API error
3. Network issues
4. Missing environment variables

### Fallback Response Types

**Price Queries:**

```typescript
if (lowerMessage.includes('cost') || lowerMessage.includes('price')) {
  return `Our courses range from ${priceRange}.
          For detailed pricing and payment plans,
          contact us on WhatsApp: +44 7404568207`;
}
```

**Help/Support:**

```typescript
if (lowerMessage.includes('help') || lowerMessage.includes('support')) {
  return "I'd be happy to connect you with our support team!
          Contact us on WhatsApp: +44 7404568207";
}
```

**Course Recommendations:**

```typescript
if (lowerMessage.includes('recommend') || lowerMessage.includes('course')) {
  const course = getCourseRecommendations()[0];
  return `I recommend **${course.title}** (${course.price}, ${course.duration})...`;
}
```

**Generic Error:**

```typescript
return "I'm experiencing technical difficulties,
        but I'm still here to help!
        Contact us on WhatsApp: +44 7404568207";
```

**Assessment:** ‚úÖ Fallback system is working well and provides helpful guidance
