# AIBorg Learn Sphere - Spec-Kit Setup

This directory contains the Spec-Driven Development configuration for the AIBorg Learn Sphere project.

## What is Spec-Kit?

Spec-Kit is a toolkit from GitHub that enables Spec-Driven Development - an approach where specifications become executable and directly generate working implementations rather than just guiding them.

## Project Structure

```
spec-kit/
├── constitution.md      # Project principles and guidelines
├── specifications.md    # Detailed feature specifications
├── plans/              # Implementation plans
├── tasks/              # Task breakdowns
└── implementations/    # Generated code
```

## How to Use

### 1. Review the Constitution
Read `constitution.md` to understand the project's core principles, quality standards, and non-negotiables.

### 2. Review Specifications
Check `specifications.md` for detailed feature requirements and success metrics.

### 3. Use Slash Commands with Claude Code

When working with Claude Code (claude.ai/code), use these commands:

#### `/constitution`
Establish or update project principles:
```
/constitution Update the constitution to include new security requirements for OWASP Top 10 compliance
```

#### `/specify`
Create or update specifications:
```
/specify Add a new feature for student discussion forums with threading, voting, and moderation capabilities
```

#### `/plan`
Generate implementation plans:
```
/plan Create a plan to implement the course filtering feature using React Query and optimistic updates
```

#### `/tasks`
Break down work into actionable tasks:
```
/tasks Break down the enrollment system implementation into specific development tasks
```

#### `/implement`
Execute the implementation:
```
/implement Implement the course display filtering feature based on the current specifications
```

## Current Specifications

### Core Features Specified:
1. ✅ Course Management System
2. ✅ Enrollment & Payment System
3. ✅ Learning Dashboard
4. ✅ AI-Powered Features
5. ✅ Event Management
6. ✅ Review & Feedback System
7. ✅ Blog & Content Management
8. ✅ Admin Dashboard

### Technical Requirements:
- Performance: < 3s page load, < 500ms API response
- Security: SOC 2, GDPR compliant, E2E encryption
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Scale: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users

## Next Steps

1. **Create Implementation Plan**:
   ```
   /plan Design the implementation for the enhanced course filtering system with display field support
   ```

2. **Generate Tasks**:
   ```
   /tasks Create tasks for implementing the JSON-based course and event creation system
   ```

3. **Implement Features**:
   ```
   /implement Build the course template processing system that reads JSON and updates Supabase
   ```

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The spec-kit setup works alongside the existing React/TypeScript codebase:
- Specifications guide new feature development
- Constitution ensures code quality standards
- Plans provide technical implementation details
- Tasks integrate with existing project management

## Best Practices

1. **Update Specifications First**: Before implementing new features, update the specifications
2. **Maintain Constitution**: Keep the constitution current with project evolution
3. **Version Control**: Commit specification changes alongside code changes
4. **Team Alignment**: Share specifications with the team for alignment
5. **Regular Reviews**: Review specifications quarterly for relevance
