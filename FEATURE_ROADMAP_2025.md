## 1. Feature Prioritization Framework

### 1.1 RICE Scoring Methodology

**RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort**

**Reach** (How many users affected?)
- 10 = All users (100%)
- 7 = Large segment (50-75%)
- 4 = Medium segment (25-50%)
- 1 = Small segment (<25%)

**Impact** (How much improvement?)
- 10 = Massive (game-changer, 10x improvement)
- 7 = High (major improvement, 3-5x)
- 4 = Medium (noticeable, 2x)
- 1 = Low (incremental, 20-50%)

**Confidence** (How certain?)
- 100% = High (proven, validated)
- 70% = Medium (likely, some validation)
- 40% = Low (hypothesis, needs validation)

**Effort** (Person-months)
- 0.5 = 1-2 weeks
- 1 = 2-4 weeks
- 2 = 1-2 months
- 4 = 2-4 months
- 8 = 4-6 months
- 16 = 6+ months

### 1.2 Strategic Fit Score (1-10)

Alignment with **"Hybrid Learning Ecosystem"** positioning:
- 10 = Perfect fit (core differentiator)
- 7 = Strong fit (enabler)
- 4 = Moderate fit (nice-to-have)
- 1 = Weak fit (distraction)

### 1.3 Combined Priority Score

**Priority Score = RICE × (Strategic Fit / 10)**

Higher score = higher priority
