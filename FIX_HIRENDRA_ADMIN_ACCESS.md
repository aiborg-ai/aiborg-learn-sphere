# üö® FIX ADMIN ACCESS FOR hirendra@gmail.com

## Problem Identified

Your profile has `role = 'admin'` in the database ‚úÖ, but you still can't access `/admin` ‚ùå

**Root Cause:** `profile.user_id` doesn't match your actual `auth.users.id`

This means the frontend can't find your profile when you sign in, even though it exists!

## ‚ö° Quick Fix (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/afrulkxxzcmngbrdfuzj/sql

---

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic Query

Copy and paste this into the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Diagnose the issue
SELECT
  'DIAGNOSIS' as check_type,
  (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') as correct_auth_user_id,
  (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') as current_profile_user_id,
  (SELECT role FROM profiles WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') as role,
  CASE
    WHEN (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com') =
         (SELECT user_id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com')
    THEN '‚úÖ LINKED CORRECTLY - Issue is elsewhere'
    ELSE '‚ùå MISMATCH FOUND - Run the fix below'
  END as diagnosis;
```

Click **RUN**

**Expected Output:**

- diagnosis = `‚ùå MISMATCH FOUND - Run the fix below`

This confirms the problem!

---

### Step 3: Run the Fix

Copy and paste this into the SQL editor:

```sql
-- FIX: Update profile.user_id to match auth user
UPDATE profiles
SET
  user_id = (SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com'),
  updated_at = now()
WHERE email = 'hirendra@gmail.com';
```

Click **RUN**

**Expected Output:** `UPDATE 1`

---

### Step 4: Verify the Fix

Copy and paste this into the SQL editor:

```sql
-- Verify the fix worked
SELECT
  'VERIFICATION' as status,
  p.email,
  p.user_id as profile_user_id,
  au.id as auth_user_id,
  p.role,
  CASE
    WHEN p.user_id = au.id THEN '‚úÖ FIXED SUCCESSFULLY'
    ELSE '‚ùå STILL MISMATCHED'
  END as fix_status
FROM profiles p
JOIN auth.users au ON au.email = p.email
WHERE p.email = 'hirendra@gmail.com';
```

Click **RUN**

**Expected Output:**

- fix_status = `‚úÖ FIXED SUCCESSFULLY`
- role = `admin`
- profile_user_id = auth_user_id (same UUID)

### Step 5: Refresh Your Session

**CRITICAL:** You must sign out and sign in again to refresh your session!

1. Go to http://localhost:8080
2. Click your name in top-right navbar
3. Click **"Sign Out"**
4. Close the browser tab
5. Open a new tab
6. Go to http://localhost:8080/auth
7. Sign in with `hirendra@gmail.com`
8. Wait for sign-in to complete

---

### Step 6: Test /admin Access

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/admin
2. **SUCCESS!** You should now see the admin dashboard! üéâ

---

## üìä What to Check

### Browser Console (F12)

You should now see these logs:

```
[useAuth] Checking for existing session...
[useAuth] Fetching profile for user: [your-uuid]
[useAuth] Profile fetched successfully: { role: "admin", ... }
[Admin] Auth loaded, checking admin access: { isAdmin: true }
[Admin] Access granted - fetching admin data
```

### If Still Not Working

1. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any red errors
   - Look for `[useAuth]` and `[Admin]` logs

2. **Verify you're signed in as hirendra@gmail.com**
   - Top-right navbar should show your email
   - Not signed in as a different account

3. **Clear browser cache**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
   - Or clear browser storage in DevTools

4. **Try incognito/private browsing**
   - This eliminates cache issues
   - Sign in fresh and test
